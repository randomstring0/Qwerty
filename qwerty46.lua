This script will check if the executor you are using has a replicatesignal
if the executor has a replicatesignal the script will have a permanentdeath function and support in many games such as brookhaven and almost any games
and if it does not have a replicatesignal the script will automatically use the respawn loop method


// can you make it without hats? for universal
answer : no

// does this include free hats?
answer : yes 

// does this script work for universal game?
answer : yes

// why my arm gone?
answer : I'm guessing you're not wearing the hats I've linked above.

// why the script not working / keep crashing ?
answer : There are several possibilities why the script doesn't work, the first = the executor you are using is probably not supported, the second possibility = you copied the script incorrectly (you can copy all the text in this link https://github.com/randomstring0/Qwerty/edit/main/qwerty46.lua), and the third possibility = you spammed the script

// how to wear 2 hats paid hats version on mobile?
answer : The method is the same as above, only you need an additional application that can be used to download extensions, such as an application called "Kiwi Browser".
